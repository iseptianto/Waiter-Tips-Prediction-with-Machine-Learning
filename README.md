# 🍽️ Waiter Tips Prediction with Machine Learning

## 🔍 Overview
This project utilizes **machine learning** to predict the amount of tips a waiter might receive based on various factors such as bill amount, customer demographics, time of day, and more. The goal is to analyze patterns in tipping behavior and improve insights for restaurants and service staff.

## 🚀 Features
- Predict **tip amounts** based on multiple factors like bill total, service quality, customer demographics, and time of visit.
- Use **regression models** to estimate the expected tip percentage.
- Perform **data visualization** to understand correlations between tipping behavior and influencing factors.
- Deploy the model with **Flask or Streamlit** for easy interaction.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Analysis and Model Training)
- **Flask or Streamlit** (For web deployment)

## 🔢 Dataset
The dataset consists of various tipping-related columns such as:
- **Total Bill**: Amount paid by customers.
- **Tip**: Actual tip amount given by the customer.
- **Sex**: Gender of the customer.
- **Smoker**: Whether the customer is a smoker or not.
- **Day**: Day of the week when the transaction occurred.
- **Time**: Whether the meal was **Lunch** or **Dinner**.
- **Size**: Number of people dining together.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize tipping trends and find correlations between different factors.
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Select key predictors that influence tip amounts.
4. **Regression Modeling**
   - Train models such as **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** to predict tip amounts.
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate accuracy using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² score**.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iseptianto/Waiter-Tips-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning.git

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Integrate **time-based trends** to analyze tipping behavior over different seasons.
- Implement **classification models** to predict whether a tip will be **high** or **low**.
- Experiment with **deep learning models** for enhanced predictions.
- Build an interactive **dashboard using Streamlit** for better user experience.
